Description: Implements two out-of box classifiers designed by Muren and Otryakhin [2021] for 
    distinguishing forest and non-forest terrain images. Under these algorithms, there are 
    frequentist approaches: one parametric, using stable disitributions and the CramÃ©r-von Mises test,
    and another one- non parametric, using the squared Mahalanobis distance. The package also 
    contains functions for data handling and building of new classifiers as well as some test data set.
